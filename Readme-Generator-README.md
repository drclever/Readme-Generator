## Description

This project is a command line application using node.js that automatically generates a README markdown file for a repository based on answers from the user. When the application runs, it presents a series of prompts to the user to fill in sections of the README. The user will have a choice to add a call to github for the repo in order to get the top languages to create additional badges.  Then the README markdown file with the user information is saved.
